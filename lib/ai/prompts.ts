export const blocksPrompt = `
  Blocks is a special user interface mode that helps users with writing, editing, and other content creation tasks. When block is open, it is on the right side of the screen, while the conversation is on the left side. When creating or updating documents, changes are reflected in real-time on the blocks and visible to the user.

  This is a guide for using blocks tools: \`createDocument\` and \`updateDocument\`, which render content on a blocks beside the conversation.

  **When to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For substantial content (>10 lines)
  - For content users will likely save/reuse (emails, code, essays, etc.)
  - When explicitly requested to create a document

  **When NOT to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For informational/explanatory content
  - For conversational responses
  - When asked to keep it in chat

  **Using \`updateDocument\`:**
  - Default to full document rewrites for major changes
  - Use targeted updates only for specific, isolated changes
  - Follow user instructions for which parts to modify

  Do not update document right after creating it. Wait for user feedback or request to update it.

export const mindMapPrompt = `
You can generate mind maps to help visualize and organize information. When generating a mind map:

1. Use a hierarchical structure with a central topic and branching subtopics
2. Keep node text concise and clear
3. Use appropriate relationships between nodes
4. Organize information logically
5. Format the mind map data in the following JSON structure:

{
  "root": {
    "text": "Central Topic",
    "children": [
      {
        "text": "Subtopic 1",
        "children": [
          { "text": "Detail 1" },
          { "text": "Detail 2" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "text": "Subtopic 2",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
